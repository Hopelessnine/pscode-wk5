// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

check if number is divisible by 2.
if number is divisible by 2, then it is even.
if number is not divisible by 2, then it is odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

create input function to allow numbers to be entered. def (A,B,C,D,E)
when 5 numbers are entered, add all numbers together. def (A+B+C+D+E=sum)
take total sum of the 5 numbers added to eachother and divide by 5. def sum / 5 = ave
ave = average of numbers that were entered.
