// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

check if number is divisible by 2.
if number is divisible by 2, then it is even.
if number is not divisible by 2, then it is odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

take in each number entered and order them from smallest value to largest value.
B) add all numbers entered together and then divide by 5.  the number given after the division is your average.
C) since we ordered the numbers from smallest value to largest value, take the first and last number to get the highest and lowest number.
